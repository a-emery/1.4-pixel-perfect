# 1.4-pixel-perfect

This was my first weekend project after a week of learning CSS and HTML. The goal of this assignment was to create a pixel perfect recreation of an image. Unfortunately, I do not have the specific font file to match up prefectly with the image, but I matched fonts as closely as I can. I also made a mobile version of this project
Here is the image I used to create this project:
